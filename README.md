# JavaFX JCrackEngine
Crack Engine is JavaFX overlay for creating 2D games

## Actual Goals
- Upgrade physics engine
- Produce physics engine demos
- World partitioning
## Current work
Currently i am working on physics engine. Basic collisions with circles work without any problem. I have also managed to add rigid bodies and gravity, drag force can allso be applied to the body. Now i focus on developing box-box collison and adding angular velocity to them.
## Roadmap (in canvas, i like graphs)
